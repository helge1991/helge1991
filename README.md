### Hi there üëã

üíº As a former sales emloyee in the healthcare sector I've experienced the process of strategic selling. I had a deep insight into the German market for IT-solutions and personnel services in hospitals, rehabs and care facilities.

‚úÖ After some time working and performing in Berlin, I came to the conclusion that I wanted to have a greater influence on my surroundings. As a result, I shifted my attention back to data science, that intrigued me during my masters program. Therefore, I signed up for a 12 week data science bootcamp with the Spiced Academy in Berlin to expand my skill set and knowledge.

üè¢ In 2021 I've finished my Master's programme with the realization of my master's thesis; an empirical study on company performance and compensation of managers. The project included data acquisition for demographic characteristics of 224 DAX-CEOs in 2010-2019 and evaluation with OLS-regression models.
In the written elaboration and presentation, it was crucial to communicate the subject-specific methods and results in an understandable way, even to people who are not familiar with the subject. I completed both the thesis and the colloquium with an overall grade of 1,0 (GPA 4.0).
You can access my thesis in German [here](https://1drv.ms/b/s!ArkbOV1h0n0ogSOFU8_qVNoAvOfx?e=RUrv0q).

üçÑ I have a great passion for collecting eatable mushrooms. That is the reason, why I chose the use of machine learning for mushroom growth as my final project to be able to improve my own search in Berlin and Brandenburg. The most important parts of my project was data acquisition with web scraping, regression models for predictive analytics and object detection with Roboflow and YOLOv8. 
You can access my findings in form of a Powerpoint presentation [here](https://1drv.ms/b/s!ArkbOV1h0n0ogSS4tmV4NGhmRQTj?e=1pWRhC). If you want to see a 2-minute video extract of my final presentation on 4th of April 2023 in the Spiced Academy Berlin you can access it [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/helge-r%C3%B6lleke-a3474a135_datascience-deeplearning-machinelearning-activity-7051878395869065216-H04H/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).
 
üå≥ I‚Äôm was working with a team on the data project "Girls in Tech Hackathon: Hack for the environment" until Aug 23, 2023. In a group of 3 people we have created an app on Streamlit that guides accurate waste identification by the use of image recognition. For more informations about the project, the outcome and the Streamlit application you can enter the repository [here](https://github.com/helge1991/TrashBestie).

### I am open to work!

üî≠ I‚Äôm looking for a job in a Data Science related field from now on. 
This could be anything related to data e.g. Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Research Associate, Data Engineer etc.
